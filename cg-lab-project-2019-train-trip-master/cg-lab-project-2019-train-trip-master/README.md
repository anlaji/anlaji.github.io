**Special Effect Description** (Describe how they work in principle and how you implemented them.)

1. Train with two composed complex objects, many cubes and a light. Wheels appear to be moving, because of the rotation of a bar.
2. Tunnel, complex object
3. Trainstation, composed object with some ilumination
4. Trees, also composed object with/without a bird -loaded model-, which rotates, different materials for the leaves and trunk
5. Terrain from heightmap, get the height from a picture (in vertex shader) and 
a mixture of textures is applied (in fragment shader).
6. Camera animation (starts automatically + manually control after animation)
7. One light moving above the terrain.
